Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

Rules:
- If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
- If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
- If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
- If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

score :: Float -> Float -> Int
score x y
  | distance <= 1  = 10
  | distance <= 5  = 5
  | distance <= 10 = 1
  | otherwise     = 0
  where distance = sqrt (x^2 + y^2)

Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:

Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years
Earth: orbital period 1.0 Earth years, 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
Mars: orbital period 1.8808158 Earth years
Jupiter: orbital period 11.862615 Earth years
Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

So if you were told someone were 1,000,000,000 seconds old, you should be able to say that they're 31.69 Earth-years old.
